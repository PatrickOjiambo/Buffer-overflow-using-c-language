# Buffer-overflow-using-c-language
A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations../It is a vulnerability because error occurs when there is more data in a buffer than it can handle, causing data to overflow into adjacent storage. This vulnerability can cause a system crash or, worse, create an entry point for a cyberattack. C and C++ are more susceptible to buffer overflow.
